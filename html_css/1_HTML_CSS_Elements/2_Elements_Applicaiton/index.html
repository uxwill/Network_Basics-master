		<p><strong>Independant hemispheres </strong>

				<h5>The classic demonstration of hemispheric independence in a split-brain patient runs as follows:</h5>
		    	<ul>
				<li>Show the right hemisphere a word— egg, say— by briefly flashing it in the left half of the visual field, and the subject (speaking from his language-dominant left hemisphere) will claim to have seen nothing at all.</li>
				<li> Ask him to reach behind a partition and select with his left hand (which is predominantly controlled by the right hemisphere) the thing that he “did not see,” and he will succeed in picking out an egg from among a multitude of objects. </li>
				<li>
		 Ask him the right hemisphere) the thing that he “did not see,” and he will succeed in picking out an egg from among a multitude of objects. </li>
				<li>Ask him to name the item he now holds in his left hand without allowing the left hemisphere to get a look at it, and he will be unable to reply. </li>
				<li>If shown the egg and asked why he selected it from among the available materials, he will probably confabulate an answer (again, with his language-dominant left hemisphere), saying something like “Oh, I picked it because I had eggs for breakfast yesterday.” </li>
